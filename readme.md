tetris (but in Go this time)

I don't think Go is really meant to be used in an OOP fashion, but my experience + making a game really steer me towards that. As a result I think I more fit Go to my style, rather than utilizing what it does best.
With a different project and some more experience in the language, I could see it being a good specialist choice for something heavily using coroutines.
